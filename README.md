# Behaviorial Cloning Project


This project as done as part of udacity self driving car engineer nano degree[https://www.udacity.com/drive], The idea is to mimic the human driving pattern on to a self driving car using deep learning approaches.

The car is driven in the (simulator)[https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim] and the recorded data is used train the neural network and achieve a autonomosu control of the car.
